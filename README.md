A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## üåü Project Overview:
This project focuses on bridging the gap between physical steering wheel inputs and digital gameplay actions. By integrating the power of color recognition, image processing, and keyboard simulation, I've created a seamless interface that enables players to control in-game actions simply by manipulating a simulated steering wheel.
## üîç Key Features:
Color Detection, Steering Action Recognition, Keyboard Simulation, Automation
## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Implementation:
- Utilized OpenCV to detect and recognize colors representing different indicators on the steering wheel.

- Applied various image processing techniques, including Gaussian blurring and morphological operations, to enhance the quality of the captured images and reduce background noises.

- The system operates in real-time, continuously analyzing the camera feed from the simulated steering wheel and generating appropriate keyboard inputs to control the car
